# Portfolio

## Description
I wanted to try building a portfolio to practice my html and CSS skills along with trying out some new skills learned such as Responsive Design. At the moment, I do not have many applications to showcase so I used some previous work as proof of concept. I hope to build on this project to create better sites and a better future portfolio. I had some issues with layout because I had at first decided to use a grid to control my images, but decided to change to a flex box. I learned to not be afraid to change the code and to test frequently. I also found the inspect tool on Chrome, Firebox and Safari very useful. Lastly, I got more practice with using GitHub as I had to deploy most of my previous work.
